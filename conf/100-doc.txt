# Metric Query Example
#-------------------------------------------------------------#

#  pg_primary_only:       <---- Branch name, distinguish different branch of a metric query
#    name: pg             <---- actual Query name, used as metric prefix, will set to branch if not provide
#    desc: PostgreSQL basic information (on primary)                    <---- query description
#    query: |                                                           <---- query string
#
#      SELECT extract(EPOCH FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)                  AS timestamp,
#             pg_current_wal_lsn() - '0/0'                           AS lsn,
#             pg_current_wal_insert_lsn() - '0/0'                    AS insert_lsn,
#             pg_current_wal_lsn() - '0/0'                           AS write_lsn,
#             pg_current_wal_flush_lsn() - '0/0'                     AS flush_lsn,
#             extract(EPOCH FROM now() - pg_postmaster_start_time()) AS uptime,
#             extract(EPOCH FROM now() - pg_conf_load_time())        AS conf_reload_time,
#             pg_is_in_backup()                                      AS is_in_backup,
#             extract(EPOCH FROM now() - pg_backup_start_time())     AS backup_time;
#
#                                <---- following field are [OPTIONAL], control execution policy
#    ttl: 10                     <---- cache ttl: how long will exporter cache it's result. set to 0 to disable cache
#    timeout: 0.1                <---- timeout: in seconds, query execeed this will be canceled. default is 0.1, set to -1 to disable timeout
#    min_version: 100000         <---- minimal supported version in server version number format, e.g  120001 = 12.1, 090601 = 9.6.1
#    max_version: 130000         <---- maximal supported version in server version number format, boundary not include
#    fatal: false                <---- if query marked fatal fail, this scrape will abort immidiately
#
#    tags: [cluster, primary]    <---- tags consist of one or more string, which could be:
#                                        * 'cluster' marks this query as cluster level, so it will only execute once for same PostgreSQL Server
#                                        * 'primary' marks this query can only run on a master instance (will not execute if pg_is_in_recovery())
#                                        * 'standby' marks this query can only run on a recoverying instance (will execute if pg_is_in_recovery())
#                                        * 'dbname:<dbname>' means this query will only execute on database with name '<dbname>'
#                                        * 'extension:<extname>' means this query will only execute when extension '<extname>' is installed
#                                        * 'schema:<nspname>' means this query will only execute when schema '<nspname>' exist
#                                        * 'not:<negtag>' means this query will only execute when exporter is launch without tag '<negtag>'
#                                        * '<tag>' means this query will only execute when exporter is launch with tag '<tag>'
#                                           (tag could not be cluster,primary,standby or have special prefix)
#
#
#    metrics:                    <---- this is a list of returned columns, each column must have a name, usage, could have an alias and description
#      - timestamp:              <---- this is column name, should be exactly same as returned column name
#          rename: ts            <---- rename is optional, will use this alias instead of column name
#          usage: GAUGE          <---- usage could be
#                                        * DISCARD: completely ignore this field
#                                        * LABEL: use columnName:columnValue as a label in result
#                                        * GAUGE: use this column as a metric, which is '<query.name>_<column.name>{<labels>} column.value'
#                                        * COUNTER: same as GAUGE, except it is a counter.
